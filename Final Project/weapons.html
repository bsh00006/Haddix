<h1>The Weapons</h1>


<div="main">
	<h3>Outside of managing speed and good racing lines, racers in Neon Circuit can get an edge by collecting various power-ups such as Health restoration, Boost capsules, NEON, and last but not least, weapons. When a driver picks up a weapons capsule they are randomly given two weapons, one offensive and one defensive, with what weapons given determined by if they're in the lead or however far back they are. Offensive weapons help attack and/or slow racers in front of the driver while Defensive ones either help out the driver or are traps for racers behind them. A driver may mix and match the use of these two weapons if they desire with both weapons pulling from a pool of weapon energy that when it's depleted, a driver must pick up another power up and get another set of two weapons.
</h3>

<h2>Offensive
</h2>

<p><b>Plasma Repeater</b> - capable of rapid fire plasma bolts, the Plasma Repeater is good for shredding through nearby targets. At longer ranges the travel speed of each bolt requires the driver to lead their shots. When upgraded, each bolt is surrounded by an electric field that increases the bolt's size and lethality
</p>

<p><b>Missiles</b> - easy to use and destructive, each trigger pull launches a set of two missiles at the driver ahead of the user and will hunt them down and deal heavy damage. Unless of course, they trick the missiles with a well timed launch of a flare. When upgraded, a third missile is added to each volley.
</p>

<p><b>Proton Beam</b> - once a tool of ghost hunters but the copyright expired so we at Neon Circuit took it and modified it for vehicular destruction. While the Proton Beam has a limited range, it's ability to melt through vehicles and set them on fire is phenomenal providing the user can keep the beam centered on their target. When upgraded, a second beam is added crossed with the first to increase the overall width with no other negative repercussion of them doing this (because why would two lasers intersecting be bad?)
</p>

<p><b>Split Beam</b> - fires five bolts in a fan-shaped spread, ideal for demolishing up close targets or maybe even some groups as the bolts will spread further apart the longer they travel. When upgraded, 4 more bolts are added to each shot to fill some of the gaps.
</p>

<p><b>Satellite Laser</b> - when used, an orbital satellite is readied and will begin targeting the vehicle in first place, once it is finished locking on it will then attempt to lead its target and blast a large laser blast in front of the vehicle. A vehicle will have to swerve out of the way of the beam as it is attempting to lead them to avoid the lethal blast. When upgraded, the laser is electrified making it do residual damage to those who avoid the main blast</p>

<p><b>Blizzard</b> - launches a missile into the nearby atmosphere causing the weather to rapidly shift into a blizzard and will begin to lay large, NEON snowflakes in front of the leader of the race that while dealing no damage, will freeze a vehicle preventing any input from it's driver. Luckily this rapid change to local weather has been studied to have no long-term ill effects on the local climate and ecosystem...at least we think so. When upgraded the NEON released into the atmosphere is made even more volatile and the snowflakes produced are also on fire...again, no ill effects SHOULD happen to the local weather system.</p>

<h2>Defensive
</h2>

<p><b>Boom Boxes</b> - In a failed experiment in 8-Track technology to hold just one more track for Murder Death Kill's latest album, it turns out that the sheer amount of ROCK N' ROLL energy produced made modern boom boxes explosive in their volatility. While this technology is currently being studied for weapons manufacturing by the NSA, we here at the Neon Circuit acquired the rights to use this experimental technology for ourselves. When upgraded the boom box will now explode twice...we don't get it either.</p>

<p><b>Shielding System</b> - attorneys and politicians all over the world have tried to make the case that the Neon Circuit races are "dangerous" and a "bad influence on the youth" so, in our eternally kind hearts, we have given racers the chance to pick up a temporary NEON crafted shield that is guaranteed to guard it's user from up to 12 giganukes of raw energy for the few precious seconds it is up. When upgraded the shield's output is increased tenfold and now any driver who makes even the slightest contact with it takes lethal damage, don't thank us, we know it's more exciting this way.</p>

<p><b>Trail Blazer</b> - In the early days of the Neon Circuit, some racers tried to deploy oil slicks to give themselves an advantage over their competitors. We, of course, banned this practice, because home brought weapons, no matter how ineffective, goes against the rules we set forth. So, we set the oil on fire when we used the concept for ourselves.</p>

<p><b>Soglorr</b> - Originally sold in the Chinese Black Market as exotic pets, we at the Neon Circuit adopted them from their lives of exploitation and captivity and immediately shoved them into the weapons systems of turbo fueled death machines. When deployed, a Soglorr will wander about the track aimlessly until a vehicle runs one over, where their innate instinct for destruction will take over and they leap upon the vehicle and begin rapidly clawing at the vehicle until it is either shaken off or the vehicle is destroyed. When upgraded, Soglorrs get a cookie before deployment and thusly their instinct is already triggered where they'll now actively run towards vehicles.</p>

<p><b>Phoenix Drive</b> - We get it, you're stuck in the back and you want to catch up but lack the abilities of a competent racer to actually do something about it. What's a racer to do? Well, for the low, low price of sheer random luck, maybe you can pick up the Phoenix Drive! With the Phoenix Drive your vehicle is kicked into overdrive by going so fast your car will burst into flames! Now I know what you're saying: "If I can't drive a straight line at normal speeds, how can I when I'm blazing at subsonic velocities?" Not to worry, with the Phoenix Drive, we'll handle the steering for you! Side effects may include nausea, heart burn, genital warts, and sudden and spontaneous death. When upgraded, a vehicle will explode with flames after the Phoenix Drive ends.</p>

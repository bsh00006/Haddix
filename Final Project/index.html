<h1>Neon Circuit</h1>
<h2>A silly videogame idea by Brian Haddix</h2>

<div="main">
	<h3>It is the cybernetic future year of 2009. With the rapid expansion of technology of the past couple decades, sports entertainment has evolved. Now America and the rest of the world is now glued to their television sets watching the speed crazed, blood lust driven, destructive racing action that is the Neon Circuit. Now various drivers compete to fulfill their desires to become champion and win the multi-million dollar prize through hard fought, white knuckle excitement.
</h3>

<p>Neon Circuit is an arcade racing game idea inspired by games such as: <em><b>Jak X: Combat Racing</b></em>, <em><b>Mario Kart</b></em>, <em><b>Modnation Racers</b></em>, and <em><b>CTR: Crash Team Racing</b></em> with the overall tone of a parody of 1980's pop culture and Saturday morning cartoons of that era. A race consists of 10 drivers driving through various tracks based on over-the-top concepts and direct parodies of 80's movies and shows. Racers will collect weapons to assist in their struggle to the front by attacking and destroying cars in front of them or by keeping their competitors behind them. Boost can also be picked up or gathered via various tricks (such as drifting and getting hang time), boost can be spent for bursts of speed or spent to launch flares to protect racers from some weapons. Racers may also gather NEON (which stands for Nuclear Energy, Only Nicer) which is a resource that slightly increases a vehicle's top speed and acceleration, and more importantly, upon collecting a maximum of 10 NEON, weapons are upgraded to increase their lethality.

Please do not steal my ideas and sell to other, more competent game developers without the express permission of Brian Haddix. Consequence of idea theft will be met with me being very angy and will get huffy and not like you. Also the abandonment of my hopes and dreams and thus my reason for living, so...God, I hope you have morals.
